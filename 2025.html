          <blockquote>
         <h4>08/10</h4>
            <p>Trying to learn the monster called Blender (scary).</p>
			<p>Hope my emotions can return.</p>
             <hr>
		 <h4>06/10</h4>
            <p>Recently I've been having this obsession with doing wordplay including animals like Arbitrary Ant, Rampant Rat, Dehydrated Deer... and so on. I can't explain this but I get giddy whenever I come up with something new.<br><br>
			Aside from my eccentric obsessions, I added the <a href="/translations" target="_blank">translations</a> page... 1 month after making this site. I'm lazy but at least it has now been Completed. I just have to add the other stuff I translated aside from that one song alone.</p>
             <hr>
         <h4>01/10</h4>
            <p>October is here...! I am still battling with the internal thoughts of wanting to run away and not be known by anyone... maybe I'll venture off to find a cave of my own.</p>
			  <p>It's awful out here, Socrates.</p>
		    <p>Psychological hell aside, I have recovered from the Coof‚Ñ¢ after 2 weeks of dealing with it. Not Very Fun. But during that time, I binged Dungeon Meshi and Chi. Chikyuu. For my impressions of these 2, I will start with Dungeon Meshi. There will be no major spoilers for both.</p>
            <h5>Dungeon Meshi</h5>
			  <p>The first impression of Dungeon Meshi was that it was okay at first; it seemed like an average anime centered around cooking monsters resembling real-world human cuisine. 
				  And it was for the first 8 episodes, which is... REALLY long, and it can put off a lot of people, but I like iyashikei, so it didn't bother me that most of the episodes were relatively uneventful. 
				  Then in episode 8 (?), there was a flashback centered around Falin and Marcille, which is when the story started to actually get going.</p>
			  <p>When the story started to shift from just killing monsters and eating them to an overarching storylinewith all the aforementioned characters popping up again in order to build suspense for a seemingly large story, that's when it started to really get good (around ep 13.) 
				  The main 4 party members grew on me, and I started to enjoy seeing their interactions. He is not a part of the main party, but I like Kabru; I think he has 76 mental illnesses and is banned from every Walmart in the world.</p>
			  <p>In general, I'm surprised that I ended up liking it a lot more than Frieren, and I think that's because I don't like how Frieren feels shounen... as shounen anime tends to be my least favorite. Dungeon Meshi is a seinen, which might explain why I enjoyed it more. As a fantasy anime,
               I am glad that Dungeon Meshi went deep with the world-building and unique monsters and races, as other fantasy anime tend to just put in magic and, maaaaaaybe, some elves and call it a day. It's probably the best in the fantasy genre. „ÅîÈ¶≥Ëµ∞„Åï„Åæ„Åß„Åó„ÅüÔºÅ</p>
			  <h5>Chi. Chikyuu</h5>
			  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3oAbV2g.png" width=60%>
			  <br>
			  <small>This world is conveniently incomplete, that's why I want to know...</small>
			  <p>Orb, my beloved. I was intending to watch this as it was releasing but was experiencing anime fatigue at the time and wasn't able to keep up with several at once, so I put it off for... <i>[takes a look at hand-drawn watch on my wrist]</i> a year. Oops. 
				  But watching the first 3 episodes alone, it was very, very compelling. It gave the feeling that this is a <b>tribute</b> to humanity's researchers in the past, the people whose names were never acknowledged, and the blood and hard work that never came into fruition. 
				  As a major enjoyer of history- specifically when humans were making major discoveries of our world, which became common knowledge today, which we take for granted - watching this was a major treat for me.</p>
			  <p>I ended up giving this anime a 10/10, which hasn't happened in 2 years, and it reignited my love for anime again since I felt recent anime was too full of... sequels or stories that didn't feel significant or important. 
				  What I seek from fiction is the author's feelings and messages, what they want to pass down to other people. This anime felt like it was just that - the author paying their tributes to humanity. I'm sure this story will stay with me for a very long time, 
				  and it's a strange, poignant feeling when you know that you're watching something that will stick with you for a very long time.</p>
			  <p>Thank you, MADHOUSE, for your hard work on Chi. Chikyuu and Sakanaction for making such a wonderful opening that suits the story Chi tries to tell. I'll definitely keep track of Uoto-san's other works. 
				  I heard that "Hyakuemu" is another one of their works, so I might watch the movie when English subtitles for it come out.</p>
             <hr>
         <h4>24/09</h4>
            <p>Thinking a lot about if I should publish my writings about contemporary society which I wrote when I was 15. My personal thoughts on these writings, for the most part, is that <b>wow</b>, was I pessimistic about people.</p>
			  <p>I think some of these writings can be published but for the obviously personal ones pertaining to my emotions, maybe not. The one that I am thinking of maybe putting out is the one where I was questioning the usage of the word "smart" and "stupid", 
				  generally just criticism of how academics seems to be the main way of concluding our intelligence which obviously doesn't work for those who have a difficult time functioning or not having their needs met (leading to poor grades).</p>
			  <p>Viewing these things that I wrote, I don't really agree with the way I worded things, namely just using seemingly complex words for the sake of seeming cool or knowledgeable so maybe I'll revise them to be more concise and some other ideas that I don't agree with.
			  Brevity is the soul of the wit, you don't need to constantly look for synonyms and stress the same points over and over to make something seem of higher quality.</p>

			<h5>modern vocaloid songs</h5>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ggoj6BN.png" width=50%>
            <p>I feel like I haven't heard a Rin or Gumi orisong in years (disappointed tone). But good news... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6MFHc_SoOg" target="_blank">SIINAMOTA SONG PERFORMED IN THE BIG 2025 AT MAGICAL MIRAI</a></p>
             <hr>
         <h4>07/09</h4>
            <p>Added <a href="/philosophy" target="_blank">philosophy</a>, <a href="/writing" target="_blank">writing</a> 
            and <a href="/credits" target="_blank">credits</a> pages.</p>
			  <p>Sleep should have happened 4 hours ago (it's 5 AM now), but adding stuff to the philosophy page was really fun.</p>
             <hr>
         <h4>04/09</h4>
            <p>The site is coming along nicely so far. I added most of the necessary pages, and the fact that this page is live means I no longer require social medias like X to announce my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Personally, I'm very satisfied with the design I went with for this site. It's sleek and modern, just the way I like it. ( ‚îÄ ‚Äø ‚îÄ)</p>
