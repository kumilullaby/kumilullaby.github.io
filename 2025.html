          <blockquote>
         <h4>24/09</h4>
            <p>Thinking a lot about if I should publish my writings about contemporary society which I wrote when I was 15. My personal thoughts on these writings, for the most part, is that <b>wow</b>, was I pessimistic about people.</p>
			  <p>I think some of these writings can be published but for the obviously personal ones pertaining to my emotions, maybe not. The one that I am thinking of maybe putting out is the one where I was questioning the usage of the word "smart" and "stupid", 
				  generally just criticism of how academics seems to be the main way of concluding our intelligence which obviously doesn't work for those who have a difficult time functioning or not having their needs met (leading to poor grades).</p>
			  <p>Viewing these things that I wrote, I don't really agree with the way I worded things, namely just using seemingly complex words for the sake of seeming cool or knowledgeable so maybe I'll revise them to be more concise and some other ideas that I don't agree with.
			  Brevity is the soul of the wit, you don't need to constantly look for synonyms and stress the same points over and over to make something seem of higher quality.</p>

            <p>I feel like I haven't heard a Rin or Gumi orisong in years (disappointed tone). But good news... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6MFHc_SoOg" target="_blank">SIINAMOTA SONG PERFORMED IN THE BIG 2025 AT MAGICAL MIRAI</a></p>

         <h4>07/09</h4>
            <p>Added <a href="/philosophy" target="_blank">philosophy</a>, <a href="/writing" target="_blank">writing</a> 
            and <a href="/credits" target="_blank">credits</a> pages.</p>
			  <p>Sleep should have happened 4 hours ago (it's 5 AM now), but adding stuff to the philosophy page was really fun.</p>
             <hr>
         <h4>04/09</h4>
            <p>The site is coming along nicely so far. I added most of the necessary pages, and the fact that this page is live means I no longer require social medias like X to announce my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Personally, I'm very satisfied with the design I went with for this site. It's sleek and modern, just the way I like it. ( â”€ â€¿ â”€)</p>
