         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>II.</small>
          <p>I think like with taking care of pets, people should be more aware of the amount of responsibility it takes to love someone and make the conscious effort to be with them. It is another life you're interacting with, after all.</p>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>I.</small>
          <p>Both religion and science can't be independent; religion answers what science can't, and science answers what religion couldn't.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Puritanism</h1>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
