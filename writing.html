          <blockquote>
          <h1>Puritanism</h1>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>„Åù„Çì„Å™„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂ•¥</h1>
          <small>That kind of person</small>
            <p>I don't want to go down in history. I don't want to be someone. 
            <br><br>Yet, I have some lingering feelings of wanting to leave something meaningful behind.
<br><br>I want to be remembered as a "nobody", someone who was just a passing phase in people's lives.
<br><br>I want to be someone people don't think of when they think of someone they enjoy hanging out with. Someone that fades into the background. Irrelevancy.
<br><br>I want to make things, but not have these creations be remembered for me but for the creations itself.
<br><br>Maybe it's a lonely kind of desire, but I find the idea of someone still thinking of me 10 years later a way more terrifying prospect.
<br><br>I want to talk to people, but not with the intent of getting closer, but to kill time.</p>
