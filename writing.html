          <blockquote>
         <h1>Friendships</h1>
		 <small>2022</small>
          <p>I think one of the worst things people can do is probably put "pressure" on that a friendship has to be in a constant state of "give" and "take". Perhaps it's good to have that sort of thing in a professional relationship, 
			  but I do not think it can be applied to personal relationships, such as those who are a part of your private social life.</p>
		  <p>I do not have to gain or lose something every time I talk to someone, and I do not have to belittle myself for not being capable of keeping consistency in conversations. The best one can do is talk when possessing the genuine desire to interact, not because it is expected.</p>
          <p>Are you talking to me because you feel that it is expected, or because you'd like to?</p>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>III.</small>
          <p>Different people will perceive you differently, different people will do different things with you and different people will have different notions of how much they like you. But that doesn't discredit your value, it doesn't discredit that you are vital and important.</p>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>II.</small>
          <p>I think like with taking care of pets, people should be more aware of the amount of responsibility it takes to love someone and make the conscious effort to be with them. It is another life you're interacting with, after all.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>I.</small>
          <p>Both religion and science can't be independent; religion answers what science can't, and science answers what religion couldn't.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Puritanism</h1>
		 <small>2025</small>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
