        <section>
          <blockquote>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>IV.</small>
          <p>It's thrilling to be distracted by really good storytelling. But it's more thrilling to be provoked, or even altered by it.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Living Zombie</h1>
		 <small>2022</small>
          <p>When emotionally blunted, you have more control over yourself and your mental state - at the very least, you can force yourself to do things like work without feeling as if the world is going to end, 
			  even if the emotional blunting can put up emotional walls between people you're close to. Both are negatives in the end, but at the very least there is something that works.</p>
		  <p>"It is as if the individual endorsed a strategy of playing dead to stay alive (yet becoming tragically dead-in-life in the name of life)".</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Unsociable</h1>
		 <small>2021</small>
          <p>The tendency of unsociable people is to reject and run away from others as soon as they are displeased with something, whether in the real world or on the Internet, so they cannot have a proper relationship with anyone for a long time. </p>
		  <p>As long as you continue that kind of running away habit, you will never be able to relate to anyone.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Types of people</h1>
		 <small>2025</small>
          <p>There are many types of people in this world… namely, one; those who try to tell the truth as much as they can, second; those who try to tell the truth as little as they can… and third, those who can’t differentiate between a truth and a lie. 
			  The third one is the most troublesome sort; you can never be sure, and they, too, can never be sure if what they say or do truly means anything to them personally.</p>
	      <p>They try to understand even though they share no interest in doing so, they laugh even if no one is, they speak even if they do not care to engage in a discussion, they try to connect to others even if they are unable to crave intimacy. There is always
		  this sense of "otherness" to them, and the well-adjusted naturally will try to avoid this undertone.</p>
		  <p>They’re very much more troublesome than the people who always lie, because their genuine attempts at honesty confuses everyone including themselves. It’s a tragic comedy, of some sort… like watching an extraterrestrial trying their best to connect and 
			  integrate but is lacking the ”essence”  that is the prerequisite to form genuine, human connections.</p>
		  <p>In a sense, though, aren’t the desperately real - yet dishonest attempts of connecting with people, and struggling to maintain it, more genuine than those who do not struggle?</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Friendships</h1>
		 <small>2022</small>
          <p>I think one of the worst things people can do is probably put "pressure" on that a friendship has to be in a constant state of "give" and "take". Perhaps it's good to have that sort of thing in a professional relationship, 
			  but I do not think it can be applied to personal relationships, such as those who are a part of your private social life.</p>
		  <p>I do not have to gain or lose something every time I talk to someone, and I do not have to belittle myself for not being capable of keeping consistency in conversations. The best one can do is talk when possessing the genuine desire to interact, not because it is expected.</p>
          <p>Are you talking to me because you feel that it is expected, or because you'd like to?</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>III.</small>
          <p>Different people will perceive you differently, different people will do different things with you and different people will have different notions of how much they like you. But that doesn't discredit your value, it doesn't discredit that you are vital and important.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>II.</small>
          <p>I think like with taking care of pets, people should be more aware of the amount of responsibility it takes to love someone and make the conscious effort to be with them. It is another life you're interacting with, after all.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Scattered thoughts</h1>
		 <small>I.</small>
          <p>Both religion and science can't be independent; religion answers what science can't, and science answers what religion couldn't.</p>
        <hr>
         <h1>Puritanism</h1>
		 <small>2025</small>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
