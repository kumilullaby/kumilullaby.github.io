          <blockquote>
		  <h1>?</h1>
		  <p>I want to say that I feel like I am losing myself, but I don't know if I ever had a "self" to begin with. </p>
		  <hr>
          <h1>Thoughts?</h1>
          <p>People who don't really think about anything too much sort of terrify me. I'm not sure why.</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get close to people without issue?</p>
		  <p>Is it because it's hard to talk to them?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they rarely ever have an internal crisis?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they don't delve into their hobbies too deeply?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get through life without conflict?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they're fine with having people knowing them on an interpersonal level?</p>
		  <p>Whatever it is, people like that scare me, because they surely wouldn't welcome my overthinking nature. They only would want people who'd give them a laugh with an amusing crowd.</p>
		  <p>I wish to become a person like that, but unsure how to mold into that sort of being. All I can do is watch them and hope that I can assimilate successfully. I think people who don't really think too much are one of the smarter ones, emotionally wise. They never have to worry too much about anything.</p>
	      <p>It's much smarter to not be the way I am, to not think. That's why I am an idiot and the others are more socially and mentally well-adjusted.</p>
	      <p>More-over, I don't relate to the feeling of wanting to "meet" people in real-life. I don't even know what it's like to ask your classmate for help with your homework or to go to a place in real life with someone else to have fun like the cinema. I don't know these integral experiences everyone seems to have.</p>
		  <p>I don't even have this desire for romance, instead, it's even more terrifying than just being friends with people, because your life and happiness isn't just yours anymore.</p>	  
		  <p>Maybe I am just scared of normalcy. Maybe that's it.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>Puritanism</h1>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>„Åù„Çì„Å™„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂ•¥</h1>
          <small>That kind of person</small>
            <p>I don't want to go down in history. I don't want to be someone. 
            <br><br>Yet, I have some lingering feelings of wanting to leave something meaningful behind.
<br><br>I want to be remembered as a "nobody", someone who was just a passing phase in people's lives.
<br><br>I want to be someone people don't think of when they think of someone they enjoy hanging out with. Someone that fades into the background. Irrelevancy.
<br><br>I want to make things, but not have these creations be remembered for me but for the creations itself.
<br><br>Maybe it's a lonely kind of desire, but I find the idea of someone still thinking of me 10 years later a way more terrifying prospect.
<br><br>I want to talk to people, but not with the intent of getting closer, but to kill time.</p>
