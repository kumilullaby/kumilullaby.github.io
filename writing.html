        <section>
          <blockquote>
		  <h1>2020</h1>
			  <small>writings from 2020 (meaning I probably do not agree with them now but find them interesting enough to share.)</small>
			  <p>"It'd be nice to wipe out all of the bad humans, and let the good ones stay." 
				  <br>
				  "How would we able to differentiate right from wrong, if only right existed? Can they even be called right people, now that the wrong people are gone?"</p>
			      <br><br>
			  <p>A: "Do you think people murder to announce their retirement from the human world? May it be because they finally decide to abandon the part of them that wants to feel connected with others through community feeling, 
				  and relentlessly kills its own in desperation and confusion of trying to understand other people. Is murder an outlet of these emotions for those sort of people?"</p>
			  <p>B: "I think murder happens when someone finally decides to give up on connecting and understanding with others."</p>
			  <p>"In order to communicate that they are sick of having no one to connect and understand with in a sincere way, murder is sort of like announcing to yourself that you'll never be understood nor understand others on a fundamental, emotional level.
				  <br>
				  In their madness, the only thing they can do is have some sort of emotional outlet for these emotions, which results in the crimes taking part in their lives. 
				  <br> 
				  They probably do feel terrible for committing these acts, maybe not, but to be honest, I don't think there's a single person in the world who can truly avoid others. 
				  So I suppose murder is like a manifestation of the emotions that can be among the lines of, "I am tired of people, and professionalism. There is not one who understands me nor makes the genuine effort to do so. Why should I have to put up with this? 
				  Why is it bad to express these sort of thoughts? Will I ever be understood, and appreciated by someone? All of that - interpersonal relationships - is just too much work. Too much effort."</p>
			  <p>Once people are at their wits end, emotionally and mentally exhausted from participating in human activities, that is when they are most likely to feel a spark of need to take a life.</p>
		      <p>They don't understand how people can cope with living in falsehood and exaggerated social atmospheres, so they murder them because they can't empathize with them at all. They don't understand, and think the outcome for that should be murder. 
				  "Anyone that I can't empathize with is selfish, a fraud, and does not treasure anything because they do not find any issues with living in a world like this. Those sort of people are rotten. I want to send a message."</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>The real world, again tomorrow, will function and run without me.</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>Where do you draw the line between fear and attraction?</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>I think one of the worst things people can do is probably put "pressure" on that a friendship has to be in a constant state of "take" and "give". Perhaps it's good to have that sort of thing in a business relationship, 
				  but I do not think it can be applied to personal relationships, such as those who are a part of your private social life.</p>
			  <p>I do not have to gain or lose something every time I talk to someone, and I do not have to belittle myself for not being capable of keeping consistency in conversations. The best one can do is talk when possessing the genuine desire to interact, not because it is expected.</p>
			  <p>Are you talking to me because you feel that it is expected, or because you'd like to?</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>Even in the aftermath of a tragedy, people create, people live</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>Maintaining relationships in an effort to keep them "fresh" is a very troublesome procedure indeed.</p>
			  <br><br>
			  <p>"We refer to only the things we see while we are sleeping as dreams but this futile world also doesn’t seem like the reality."</p>
			  <p>If it's difficult to understand what I wrote, it may be because English is not my native tongue. What I tried to convey is the disconnect from the concrete world. Nothing at all seems real to me. 
				  In the purest sense of living, even using the 5 senses to feel like I am living won't alleviate the disconnect I have from both humanity and nature.</p>
			  <p>Both happiness and sorrow, I can recognize, but there seems to be a glass wall that separates me from other people, so what I can do is look in from above, always observing others but never participating.</p>
		  <h1>Love</h1>
		  <p>What is love? <small>(Baby don't hurt me)</small></p>
			  <p>Jokes aside, I wonder what it truly is. I don't really get a lot of feelings in general, they feel alien to me. I don't know if this is due to Alexithymia or just inexperience. How do relationships work? Do people feel something when they spend time together? Can it be
			  properly explained? I struggle to even know if I feel love for my family, even though I feel grateful and appreciative of them. Human emotions are very difficult, huh... I envy people who can easily feel strong emotions.</p>
			  <p>Beyond just exchanging information, laughing about jokes and discussing interests, I don't see much of a point to friendships personally, so I have a harder time figuring out what romantic relationships even entail aside from physical contact with one another.</p>
			  <p>I do doubt it's something like "aromanticism" since I do have fantasies and derive enjoyment from romantic media, but I have zero desire to act out on them. What a conundrum...</p>
		  <hr>
		  <h1>Solitude</h1>
		  <p>I guess the reason why I find that animals are well off and content in living is because of the lack of human commitments they have to put up with, human existentialism, relationships, friendships, nurturing, everything like that.<br>
		  It's innately human to desire a social circle to be a part of and to have ones presence be accepted, maybe essential and helpful even to those around. This can apply to one-on-one relationships too; we want to feel some sort of justification for existing, 
			  whether it may be through talking, creating (arts, etc), or helping.</p>
		  <p>But personally, I think you'll only grow to be dependent on other people for that happiness you seek. It's not wrong to want to be happy, especially by trying to be by connecting with other people, but these connections are impermanent and can fade away, 
			  doubts and speculation can build up. I find all of these aspects of friendships to be very stressful to maintain and communicate, so if anything, I treat human interactions as a secondary need rather than a primary one.</p>
		  <p>
		  It's coming to terms with the fact that I'll probably always be in solitude and not ever go to the cinema with a hypothetical friend, or ever have an intimate discussion with someone, nor ever ask my classmates for help with homework. 
	      I'll likely never experience these sort of normal human interactions and I've grown to be OK with that. I want to build my sense of self-worth through my own efforts and aspirations, and not through someone else's. Doing so, I find it easier to be alone and to never be lonely.
		  </p>
		  <hr>
          <h1>しんどい</h1>
          <p>People who don't really think about anything too much sort of intimidate me. I'm not sure why.</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get close to people without regretting it?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get through life without conflict?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they're fine with having people know of their existence?</p>
		  <p>Whatever it is, people like that intimidate me, because they surely wouldn't welcome my overthinking nature. They only would want people who'd give them a laugh with an amusing crowd.</p>
		  <p>I think people who don't really think too much are one of the smarter ones, emotionally wise. They never have to worry too much about anything.</p>
	      <p>It's much smarter to not be the way I am, to not think. That's why I am an idiot and the others are more socially and mentally well-adjusted.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>Puritanism</h1>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>そんなみたいの奴</h1>
          <small>That kind of person</small>
            <p>I don't want to go down in history. I don't want to be someone. 
            <br><br>Yet, I have some lingering feelings of wanting to leave something meaningful behind.
<br><br>I want to be remembered as a "nobody", someone who was just a passing phase in people's lives.
<br><br>I want to be someone people don't think of when they think of someone they enjoy hanging out with. Someone that fades into the background. Irrelevancy.
<br><br>I want to make things, but not have these creations be remembered for me but for the creations itself.
<br><br>Maybe it's a lonely kind of desire, but I find the idea of someone still thinking of me 10 years later a way more terrifying prospect.
<br><br>I want to talk to people, but not with the intent of getting closer, but to kill time.</p>
