        <section>
          <blockquote>
		  <h1>Solitude</h1>
		  <p>I guess the reason why I find that animals are well off and content in living is because of the lack of human committments they have to put up with, human existentialism, relationships, friendships, nurturing, everything like that.<br>
		  It's innately human to desire a social circle to be a part of and to have ones presence be accepted, maybe essential and helpful even to those around. This can apply to one-on-one relationships too; we want to feel some sort of justification for existing, 
			  whether it may be through talking, creating (arts, etc), or helping.</p>
		  <p>But personally, I think you'll only grow to be dependent on other people for that happiness you seek. It's not wrong to want to be happy, especially by trying to be by connecting with other people, but these connections are impermanent and can fade away, 
			  doubts and speculation can build up. I find all of these aspects of friendships to be very stressful to maintain and communicate, so if anything, I treat human interactions as a secondary need rather than a primary one.</p>
		  <p>
		  It's coming to terms with the fact that I'll probably always be in solitude and not ever go to the cinema with a hypothetical friend, or ever have an intimate discussion with someone, nor ever ask my classmates for help with homework. 
	      I'll likely never experience these sort of normal human interactions and I've grown to be OK with that. I want to build my sense of self-worth through my own efforts and aspirations, and not through someone else's. Doing so, I find it easier to be alone and to never be lonely.
		  </p><p>
		  There were times where I cursed at myself for not having the qualities of the essential human traits of socialising that other seem to have that I never personally possessed, envy them for their seeming happiness found from other people that isn't born from themselves, 
		  speculating how nice it must be to have people to be with. I used to be a lot like that in my childhood - the jealous type of person, and admittedly, might still contain these traits in the present me, but since I've accepted being alone, I've been well off on my own and will likely continue to be.
		  </p>
		  <hr>
		  <h1>Ë™∞</h1>
		  <p>I want to say that I feel like I am losing myself, but I don't know if I ever had a "self" to begin with. </p>
		  <hr>
          <h1>Fear</h1>
          <p>People who don't really think about anything too much sort of terrify me. I'm not sure why.</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get close to people without regretting it?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they can get through life without conflict?</p>
		  <p>Is it because they're fine with having people know of their existence?</p>
		  <p>Whatever it is, people like that scare me, because they surely wouldn't welcome my overthinking nature. They only would want people who'd give them a laugh with an amusing crowd.</p>
		  <p>I wish to become a person like that, but unsure how to mold into that sort of being. All I can do is watch them and hope that I can assimilate successfully. I think people who don't really think too much are one of the smarter ones, emotionally wise. They never have to worry too much about anything.</p>
	      <p>It's much smarter to not be the way I am, to not think. That's why I am an idiot and the others are more socially and mentally well-adjusted.</p>
	      <p>More-over, I don't relate to the feeling of wanting to "meet" people in real-life. I don't even know what it's like to ask your classmate for help with your homework or to go to a place in real life with someone else to have fun like the cinema. I don't know these integral experiences everyone seems to have.</p>
		  <p>I don't even have this desire for romance, instead, it's even more terrifying than just being friends with people, because your life and happiness isn't just yours anymore.</p>	  
		  <p>Maybe I am just scared of "normalcy". Maybe that's it.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>Puritanism</h1>
          <p>To risk sounding pretentious; I'm not particularly into the whole moral judgement thing. I never understood that sort of thing. I think it's okay to not agree with people on some opinions but I don't particularly enjoy those who think their judgement is absolute and if you disagree with them, you're a villain that needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p>Of course, I prefer to avoid people that makes me uncomfortable, but I won't go out of my way to change their opinion about a subject. The reality is that you can't decide what people should or shouldn't say, it's not for you or anyone else to control. You should be more concerned with yourself than what other people think.</p>
          <p>This isn't really about <b>modern</b> puritans although it is applicable. Throughout history, there have always been people trying to control people under the guise of ethics when in reality they just want to feel in control and righteous for enforcing their beliefs.</p>
          <p>It's fine to stand up for what you think is right and bring awareness, but you can't ever force anyone to think or believe something. That's for them to decide.</p>
          <hr>
          <h1>„Åù„Çì„Å™„Åø„Åü„ÅÑ„ÅÆÂ•¥</h1>
          <small>That kind of person</small>
            <p>I don't want to go down in history. I don't want to be someone. 
            <br><br>Yet, I have some lingering feelings of wanting to leave something meaningful behind.
<br><br>I want to be remembered as a "nobody", someone who was just a passing phase in people's lives.
<br><br>I want to be someone people don't think of when they think of someone they enjoy hanging out with. Someone that fades into the background. Irrelevancy.
<br><br>I want to make things, but not have these creations be remembered for me but for the creations itself.
<br><br>Maybe it's a lonely kind of desire, but I find the idea of someone still thinking of me 10 years later a way more terrifying prospect.
<br><br>I want to talk to people, but not with the intent of getting closer, but to kill time.</p>
